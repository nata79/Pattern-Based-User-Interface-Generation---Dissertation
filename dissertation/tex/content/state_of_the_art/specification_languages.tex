\section{Specification languages}
\label{section:specification_languages}

In \cite{idealxml2} was stated that one of the most important challenges to overcome in model driven development of user interfaces is the creation of a specification language that would be massively adopted and became a common ground between developers like UML is for software architecture.

Over the years many languages were developed to try and overcome this obstacle. In \cite{mecano} were enumerated some of the problems found with that time user interface models:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Partial models}, most models deal only with a portion of the spectrum of interface characteristics. Some emphasize domain, others emphasize tasks, some others emphasize presentation guidelines and so on.

\item \textbf{Insufficient underlying model}, several model-based systems use modelling paradigms proven successful in other applications areas, but that come up short for interface development. These underlying models typically result in partial interface models of restricted expressiveness.

\item \textbf{System-dependent models}, many interface models are non-declarative and are embedded implicitly into their associated model-based systems, sometimes at code level. These generic models are tied to the interface generation schema of their system, and are therefore unusable in any other environment.

\end{itemize}
