\section{Optimization-based generation of interfaces}
\label{section:optimization_based_generation_of_interfaces}

Recent work is beginning to reveal that numerical optimization can play a role on modern approaches for generating interfaces and displays. GADGET\cite{gadget} and Supple\cite{supple} are two examples of this tendency.

The first is a framework that aims to provide developers with none or few knowledge on numerical optimization a set of tools that allows them to generate user interfaces through optimization methods.

The second is a tool that aims the generation of personalized user interfaces on run time. The main motivation behind Supple is that current user interfaces are developed with only a limited set of user abilities in mind leaving people with special needs with difficulties to interact with their applications.
