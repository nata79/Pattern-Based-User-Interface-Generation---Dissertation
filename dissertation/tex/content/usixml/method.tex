\section{UsiXML method}
\label{section:usixml_method}

The MDE approach allows developing the UsiXML UI by transforming progressively the UsiXML models to obtain specifications that are detailed and precise enough to be rendered or transformed into code.

The usage of the Cameleon reference framework\cite{Calvary} allowed UsiXML development to be divided in a set of phases that can be achieved through a set of transformations (see section \ref{subsection:usixml}). These features supplied a base structure for the development of an engineering method called \textit{Forward engineering method} referenced in section \ref{subsection:forward_engineering_method}. This method is an instantiation of a meta-model called \textit{Spem4UsiXML} (section \ref{subsection:spem4usixml}) that can be used to develop other engineering methods and it's based on \textit{Spem 2.0} a method meta-model specification from the OMG that is overviewed in section \ref{subsection:spem2}.
