\subsection{Spem 2.0}
\label{subsection:spem2}

SPEM is an OMG standard dedicated to software method modelling. The goal of SPEM is to propose minimal elements necessary to define any software and systems development method, without adding specific features to address particular domains. As a result, this meta-model supports a large range of development methods of different styles, levels of formalism, and life-cycle models.

SPEM is a UML profile, meaning that SPEM reuses UML whenever possible. Consequently, SPEM uses UML for various software model concepts presentations.

The current version of SPEM is 2.0 and it was completely reformulated from the previous one in order to separate the operational aspect of a method from the temporal aspect of a method. As shown in figure \ref{content/usixml/method/spem_base.png}, the SPEM 2.0 meta-model uses seven main meta-model packages:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Method Content} package describes the static aspect of a method; 
\item \textbf{Process Structure} and \textbf{Process Behaviour} packages describe the dynamic aspect of a method, \textbf{Process With Methods} package describes the link between these two aspects; 
\item \textbf{Core package} provides the common classes that are used in the different packages; \item \textbf{Method Plug-in} package describes the configuration of a method and Managed Content package describes the documentation of a method.
\end{itemize}

In the following subsections we'll go into some detail for each package in order to get a better understanding of the SPEM 2.0 method meta-model.

\subsubsection{Core package}

The Core meta-model package contains abstract generalization classes that are specialized in the other meta-model packages. These abstract generalization classes are used to define
common properties of their specialized classes. The main elements of the core package are:
\begin{itemize}
\item The \textbf{Kind class}, that expresses a refined vocabulary specific to a method;
\item \textbf{Work Definition} is an abstract generalization class that represents the work being performed by a specific role, or the work performed throughout a life-cycle.
\item \textbf{Work Definition Parameter} is an abstract generalization class that represents parameters for Work Definitions.
\item \textbf{Work Definition Performer} is an abstract generalization class that represents the relationship of a work performer (role) to a Work Definition.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Method content}

The method content meta-model package defines the core elements of every method (producer, work unit and work product) independently of any process or development project. It describes the specific development steps that are achieved by which roles with which resources and results, without specifying the placement of these steps within a specific
development life-cycle.

Figure \ref{content/usixml/method/spem_mc.png} shows the Method Content meta-model package. The main classes of the Method content meta-model are:
\begin{itemize}
\item The \textbf{Task Definition} defines the work being performed by \textit{Roles Definition instances}. A Task is associated with input and output \textit{Work Products}.

\item A \textbf{Step} describes a meaningful and consistent part of the overall work described for
a \textit{Task Definition}. The collection of Steps defined for a \textit{Task Definition} represents all the work that should be done to achieve the overall development goal of the \textit{Task Definition}.

\item The \textbf{Work Product Definition} describes the product which is used, modified, and
produced by \textit{Task Definitions}.

\item The \textbf{Role Definition} designs a general reusable definition of an organizational role. It
defines a set of related skills, competencies, and responsibilities of an individual or a set of individuals. \textit{Roles} are used by \textit{Task Definitions} to define who performs them as well as to define a set of Work \textit{Product Definitions} they are responsible for.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Process Structure}

The process structure meta-mode defines the structure of the method process. This package represents a process decomposed as a set of Activity classes that are linked to Role classes and Work Product classes. This structure is useful to express the fact that a life-cycle is composed by set of phases, and each phase is composed by set of activities.

Figure \ref{content/usixml/method/spem_ps.png} illustrates the Process Structure meta-model package. The most important classes of this meta-model are:

\begin{itemize}

\item A \textit{WorkDefinition} (coming from the Core package) is performed by a \textbf{Work
Definition Performer}, which is a role, and, through this role, by a \textit{Process Performer}.

\item A \textbf{Breakdown Element} is an abstract generalization class that defines a set of
properties available to all of its specializations.

\item A \textbf{Work Breakdown Element} provides specific properties for \textit{Breakdown Elements}
that represent work.

\item An \textbf{Activity} defines basic units of work within a process as well as a process itself. Every activity can represent a process in SPEM 2.0. It relates to \textit{Work Product Use} instances via instances of the \textit{Process Parameter} class and \textit{Role Use} instances via \textit{Process Performer} instances. An activity can be used by another activity, so that the structure of the source activity is copied into the target activity.

\item The \textbf{Role Use} represents a performer of an \textit{Activity} or a participant of the \textit{Activity}. A \textit{Role Use} is only specific to the context of an \textit{Activity}. It is not a general reusable definition of an organizational role like the \textit{Role Definition} of the Method Content package. 

\item A \textbf{Work Product Use} represents an input and/or output type for an \textit{Activity} or
represents a general participant of the \textit{Activity}.

\item The \textbf{Work Sequence} represents a relationship between two \textit{Work Breakdown Elements} in which one \textit{Work Breakdown Element} depends on the start or finish of another \textit{Work Breakdown Elements} in order to begin or end.

\end{itemize}
