\section{How to specify user interface patterns}
The patterns we're looking to specify are generative patterns as described in \cite{Generative_pattern-based_design_of_user_interfaces}. Thus the patterns have to be specified in a formal language. UML is the reference for modelling software but, as we saw on earlier sections is not ideal for user interfaces. 
The languages we'll see in this section are UsiXML and UsiPXML. These are high level languages that can be used to specify platform independent user interfaces.
